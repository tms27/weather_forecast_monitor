# Accuracy Monitor for Weather Forecast

The Python code provided in this repository can be used to assess the accuracy of the weather forecast from the three websites wetter.de, wetter.com and proplanta.de. Exemplary data and plots that can be created using this code are provided in the folders *data_examples* and *plot_examples*.

## Features
- retrieving and storing temperature, likelihood of rain and amount of rain forecasted by the three websites  
- comparison of weather forecast with actual weather data from wetterzentrale.de 
- visualization of results 

## How to use
The code is ready to use and is currently configured to assess the weather forecast of Munich, Germany. If you want to use the code for another city, you need to replace the links to the websites from which data is retrieved in the dictionary *links* at the top of the file *main.py*.
